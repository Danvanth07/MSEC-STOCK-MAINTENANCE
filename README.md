# MSEC SMART STOCK
### Smart Inventory, Asset & Distribution Management Portal
**Mohamed Sathak Engineering College (Autonomous), Kilakarai**  
*Approved by AICTE, Affiliated to Anna University, Accredited by NAAC with 'A+' Grade & NBA Accredited Programmes*

---

## 📌 Project Overview
**MSEC SMART STOCK** is an institutional ERP web application engineered to unify inventory control, asset lifecycle tracking, multi-tier procurement workflows, central store distribution, laboratory maintenance, and statutory accreditation reporting across all engineering departments.

The portal enforces institutional governance where **no purchase request bypasses the Central Store Keeper**, account creation is strictly governed by the **System Administrator**, and statutory data for **NAAC (Criterion 4)** and **NBA** are dynamically aggregated.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Launch the Server
Double-click `run.bat` or run via PowerShell:
```powershell
& 'C:\xampp\php\php.exe' -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

### 2. Open the Portal
Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```
*(If unauthenticated, you will be directed to `http://localhost:8000/index.php?route=login`)*

### 3. Database Status
The zero-configuration database is automatically provisioned and pre-seeded at `database/msec_stock.sqlite`. It seamlessly supports SQLite out of the box and can switch to MySQL/MariaDB in `config/database.php`.

To re-seed fresh test data at any time:
```powershell
& 'C:\xampp\php\php.exe' database/DatabaseSeeder.php
```

## 🔐 Institutional Security & Authentication Rules

1. **Zero Public Self-Registration**:
   - There is strictly **no public "Sign Up" or "Create Account" option**.
   - All accounts are created and provisioned exclusively by the **System Administrator** (`index.php?route=admin_users`).
2. **Admin-Only Password Reset Protocol**:
   - In accordance with college security policies, there is **no self-service email OTP or forgot password link** on the login page.
   - Users who forget their password must contact the System Administrator in person.
   - The Administrator verifies physical identity and resets the credential via the Admin Console, which is immutably logged into the audit ledger with Admin ID, IP address, and timestamp.
3. **Bruteforce Defense**:
   - Accounts are automatically locked after **5 consecutive failed login attempts**.
   - Locked accounts can only be unlocked by the System Administrator with an audit justification memo.

## 🔄 Core Workflows & Features

### 1. Store Keeper Operational Gateway & Approval Sheets
- **The Gateway Principle**: The Store Keeper is the mandatory verification gate between department authorization and institutional sanction.
- **Approval Sheet (`views/approval_sheets/view.php`)**: The Store Keeper inspects catalog balances, physical stores, vendor quotations, and prepares the official printable Approval Sheet (`AS-2026-0001`) with 4-tier signature blocks.
- **Approval Thresholds**:
  - **Tier 1 (≤ ₹5,000)**: HOD + Store Keeper
  - **Tier 2 (₹5,001 - ₹25,000)**: HOD + Vice Principal
  - **Tier 3 (₹25,001 - ₹1,00,000)**: HOD + Vice Principal + Principal
  - **Tier 4 (> ₹1,00,000)**: HOD + Vice Principal + Principal + Director

### 2. Procurement & Vendor Management (`index.php?route=procurement`)
- **Quotation Comparison Statement**: Side-by-side comparison of 3 vendor quotes with rates, taxes, delivery periods, warranty, and L1 recommendations.
- **Purchase Orders (PO)**: Generation of official POs with delivery terms, payment milestones, and printable layout (`index.php?route=view_po&id=1`).
- **Goods Receipt Notes (GRN)**: Quality inspection entry for received lots with accepted/rejected quantities, automatically updating central inventory balances.

### 3. Stock Distribution & Vouchers (`index.php?route=distribution`)
- Official Store Issue Vouchers and Delivery Challans with barcodes.
- Two-party physical and digital delivery acknowledgment (`index.php?route=view_voucher&id=1`).

### 4. Inter-Department Transfers (`index.php?route=movement`)
- Reallocation workflows (e.g. CSE transferring surplus keyboards to ECE) with multi-stage progression: `Submitted` &rarr; `Store Keeper Approved` &rarr; `Dispatched` &rarr; `Acknowledged`.

### 5. IT Asset Register & Repair Bay (`index.php?route=assets` & `route=maintenance`)
- Tracking of MAC addresses, IP addresses, serial numbers, warranty expiry, AMC details, and custodians.
- Technician workbench for diagnosing SMPS faults, logging repair costs, and requisitioning replacement spares.

### 6. Accreditation & Statutory Reports (`index.php?route=reports`)
- **NAAC Criteria 4 (IT & Infrastructure)**: PC-to-student ratio calculation (**1 : 1.8** with 1,480 student PCs), 1 Gbps leased line, Wi-Fi APs, and smart halls.
- **NBA Criteria (Lab Equipment & Maintenance)**: NABL calibration dates, next service due dates, and major equipment (> ₹50,000) utilization ledgers.
- **One-Click CSV Export**: Instant statutory download via `Export to CSV`.
