## 🏛️ 1. Institutional Profile & Project Vision

### 1.1 Institutional Context
**Mohamed Sathak Engineering College (MSEC)** is an autonomous engineering institution pioneering technical education in Kilakarai, Ramanathapuram District, Tamil Nadu. With dozens of academic departments, specialized laboratories, research centers, and thousands of students, the college requires an authoritative, auditable, and unified resource management platform.

### 1.2 System Vision
**MSEC SMART STOCK** replaces disconnected paper registers, decentralized spreadsheets, and ad-hoc email approvals with a **single source of truth** across the campus lifecycle:
* **Procurement:** Vendor directory, 3-quote comparative statements, POs, and GRNs.
* **Warehouse Control:** Central Stores custody, bin locations, minimum safety thresholds, and stock adjustments.
* **Academic Allocation:** Laboratory assets, departmental consumables, inter-department transfers, and returnable gate passes.
* **Governance & Compliance:** Multi-tier monetary approvals, permanent audit logs, and one-click statutory reports for **NAAC (Criteria 4)** and **NBA (Criterion 6 & 8)** accreditation.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Master Architecture & Technology Stack

### 2.1 Technology Stack Architecture
* **Server Runtime:** PHP 8.2+ (Modular OOP architecture, PSR-4 styled autoloading, PDO database abstraction).
* **Database Engine:** Dual Engine Strategy:
  - *Local / Development:* Portable, zero-configuration SQLite 3 (`database/msec_stock.sqlite`) pre-seeded with 14 role personas, real institutional items, vendors, and transactions.
  - *Production / Deployment:* Enterprise MariaDB 10.4+ / MySQL 8.0 (`database/schema_mysql.sql` and `database/seed_mysql.sql`) via XAMPP.
* **Presentation Tier:** Pure Vanilla CSS Design System (`public/css/style.css`) with zero external CSS frameworks (no Tailwind/Bootstrap bloat), CSS Custom Properties (Tokens), and dynamic clamp-based responsive typography.
* **Client Interactivity:** Lightweight Vanilla JavaScript (`public/js/app.js`) handling real-time searches, multi-item dynamic tables, modal dialogues, and print stylesheets.

## 🖥️ 3. Universal Display & Responsive Layout System

### 3.1 Adaptive Cross-Device Display Engine
A key institutional requirement is that the UI must look sharp, comfortable, and perfectly proportioned on **every device** without horizontal scrollbars or clipped text:
* **High-Resolution Desktop PCs (1080p, 1440p, 4K):** Generous content gutters, 2-column KPI card layouts, wide data tables with clean typography.
* **Standard Laptops (1366×768 to 1536×864):** Adaptive font clamp (`clamp(14px, 0.85rem + 0.22vw, 16.5px)`) and flexible sidebar widths (`clamp(240px, 16vw, 275px)`).
* **Windows Display Scaling (100%, 125%, 150% DPI):** Dynamic JavaScript Auto-Fit controller in `views/layout/header.php` detecting `window.devicePixelRatio` and preventing double-zoom distortion.
* **Tablets & Mobile Phones:** Off-canvas sliding navigation drawer, touch-friendly touch targets (min 44px), scrollable horizontal data-table containers, and responsive stacked summary cards.

## 👥 4. The 14 Dedicated System Roles & Access Matrix

Every stakeholder at MSEC accesses a tailored dashboard containing only the metrics, action queues, and operations relevant to their post:

## 🔒 5. Core Institutional Workflows & Non-Negotiable Rules

### Rule 1: The Store Keeper Operational Gateway
The Central Store Keeper is **never bypassed** at MSEC. Even for a ₹1 requisition, every request must pass through the Store Keeper for:
1. Verification against current warehouse balances (preventing duplicate purchases).
2. Existing stock check and specification review.
3. Official Approval Sheet generation before financial sanctions are executed.
4. Material receipt (GRN) and official Delivery Challan / Issue Voucher dispatch.

### Rule 2: Admin-Controlled Security (Zero Self-Service Resets)
To maintain strict institutional accountability:
* **No Public Self-Registration:** Accounts are provisioned exclusively by the System Administrator.
* **No Public Password Reset Links or OTPs:** If an employee forgets their password, they must contact the Central IT Administrator. The administrator verifies their identity and issues a secure reset through the Admin Console.
* **Brute-Force Lockout:** 5 consecutive failed attempts lock the account automatically, requiring administrator unlocking.

### Rule 3: Monetary Approval Threshold Matrix
All requisitions follow an automated approval ladder based on estimated value:
* **Tier 1 (Below ₹5,000):** Requester → Dept Coordinator → HOD → Central Store Keeper.
* **Tier 2 (₹5,001 – ₹25,000):** Tier 1 approvals + Vice Principal Sanction.
* **Tier 3 (₹25,001 – ₹1,00,000):** Tier 2 approvals + Principal Institutional Sanction.
* **Tier 4 (Above ₹1,00,000):** Tier 3 approvals + Director Executive Sanction.

## 👥 7. Distributed 3-Person Team Work Allocation Matrix (Lead + 2 Juniors)

To allow the 3-person development team (**Muhammad Shakil as Lead + 2 Junior Developers**) to work simultaneously across multiple PCs without code collisions, the repository enforces **Strict File Boundaries**:

| Developer | Assigned Role | Branch Name | Assigned Files to Edit (ONLY) | Key Deliverables |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Lead (Muhammad Shakil)** | **System Architect & Lead** | `main` | `core/`, `config/`, `public/index.php`, `public/css/style.css`, `views/layout/`, `views/inventory/`, `views/requests/`, `views/procurement/`, `views/distribution/`, `views/reports/`, `views/verification/`, `views/admin/` | Core architecture, database migrations, security, universal CSS layout, requisitions & approvals, procurement & POs, central inventory & vouchers, NAAC/NBA reports, and PR merging. **(Done by Muhammad alone)** |
| **Junior 1 (Colleague A)** | **IT Asset Specialist** | `feature/asset-management` | `models/Asset.php`<br>`views/assets/index.php` | Hardware specifications register (MAC, IP, Serial, AMC), damage logging modal, warranty tracking, asset RBAC guards. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Zero Conflict Guarantee:** Because Junior 1 and Junior 2 only modify their dedicated `models/` file and `views/` folder, Git merge conflicts are mathematically **ZERO (0%)**. Muhammad can merge both branches into `main` cleanly without any code collisions.

---

## 🚀 8. Step-by-Step Multi-PC Git & Branching Protocol

### 8.1 Setup on Each Team Member's Computer
Each junior developer clones the central repository and checks out their assigned branch:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tech-shakil/msec-smart-stock.git
cd msec-smart-stock

# Switch to assigned feature branch:
git checkout -b feature/asset-management         # (For Junior 1)
git checkout -b feature/stock-movement          # (For Junior 2)

# Start local server (Zero database config required; SQLite is pre-seeded):
run.bat
# (Or: php -S localhost:8000 -t public)

# Open in browser: http://localhost:8000
```

### 8.2 Submitting Work (Pull Request Workflow)
When a developer completes their tasks:
```bash
# Stage and commit only their assigned files
git add <assigned_files>
git commit -m "feat(<module>): implement assigned features and test cases"

# Push to their feature branch
git push origin <feature_branch_name>
```
*The developer then visits GitHub and opens a **Pull Request (PR)** targeting the `main` branch.*

### 8.3 How the Team Lead (Muhammad) Merges
1. Open each Pull Request on GitHub.
2. Inspect `Files Changed` to verify the developer stayed within their file boundaries.
3. Click **Merge Pull Request** → **Confirm Merge**.
4. Pull the merged code down to the Lead PC:
   ```powershell
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```
