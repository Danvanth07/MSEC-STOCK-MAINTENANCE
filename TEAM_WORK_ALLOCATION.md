## 🗄️ 3. Database Deployment (MySQL / MariaDB via XAMPP)

The system currently runs on an embedded, zero-configuration SQLite database (`database/msec_stock.sqlite`) which is already pre-seeded and active.

When you want to deploy to **XAMPP MySQL / MariaDB**:
1. Open XAMPP Control Panel and click **Start** next to MySQL.
2. In phpMyAdmin or MySQL CLI, create the database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE msec_stock CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
   ```
3. Import the enterprise schema and seed scripts:
   - Schema: `database/schema_mysql.sql`
   - Seed data: `database/seed_mysql.sql`
4. In `config/database.php`, change `'default' => 'sqlite'` to `'default' => 'mysql'`.
