# MSEC SMART STOCK — UI & Workflow Documentation
**Mohamed Sathak Engineering College (Autonomous), Kilakarai**  
*Institutional Inventory, Asset, Procurement, Distribution, Transfer, Approval, Audit & Compliance Portal*

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Design System

### 1.1 Overview
**MSEC SMART STOCK** is an enterprise-grade ERP portal designed for engineering institutions. It unifies college-wide inventory management, asset custody tracking, multi-tier requisition workflows, Store Keeper operational verification, comparative vendor quotations, Purchase Order (PO) issuance, Goods Receipt Note (GRN) quality inspections, inter-departmental transfers, repair bay tracking, annual departmental budgets, and NAAC/NBA statutory compliance reporting.

### 1.2 Design Philosophy & Aesthetics
- **Color Palette**:
  - Primary Dark Navy: `#102a43` / `#17365d` (Header, Brand Badges, Letterheads)
  - Accent Institutional Blue: `#2563eb` / `#1d4ed8` (Active Actions, Primary Buttons)
  - Neutral Background: `#f4f7fb` (Subtle off-white contrast against cards)
  - Status Indicators: Emerald Green (`#15803d`), Amber Yellow (`#b45309`), Crimson Red (`#b91c1c`), Indigo Purple (`#4338ca`)
- **Typography**: Inter / Outfit modern sans-serif typography with strict hierarchy (`h1`-`h4`, micro-labels, uppercase section trackers).
- **Glassmorphism & Micro-Interactions**: Subtle shadows (`box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`), smooth pill tabs, sticky table headers, touch-friendly scrollable filters, and interactive modals.
- **Print Media Optimization**: Full `@media print` stylesheets across official institutional documents, hiding screen navigation, rendering crisp college letterhead banners (`images/msec_letterhead.png`), barcoding fonts, and formal multi-tier signature blocks.

## 2. Institutional Authentication & Security Policy

### 2.1 Zero Public Self-Registration
- **Policy**: Public registration is completely prohibited. There is **no** "Create Account" or "Sign Up" button on the login screen.
- **Provisioning**: User accounts are created exclusively by the **System Administrator** via `index.php?route=admin_users`.
- **Identity Fields**: Username, institutional email (`@msec.org.in`), employee ID (`EMP-XXXX`), designation, assigned role, department, and laboratory mapping.

### 2.2 Strict Admin-Only Password Reset Protocol
- **Policy**: In accordance with college governance, there is **no** self-service "Forgot Password?" email or OTP reset option on the login portal.
- **Protocol**: If a user forgets their password, they must contact the System Administrator. The Administrator verifies employee identity in person, performs an authenticated reset via the administrative console (`admin_users`), and the event is permanently logged into the immutable audit trail (`audit_logs`) with IP address, timestamp, and Admin ID.

### 2.3 Bruteforce Auto-Locking
- The portal enforces account locking after **5 consecutive failed attempts**.
- Accounts remain locked until explicitly unlocked by the System Administrator with an audit justification memo.

## 4. Key Workflows & Operational Life Cycles

### 4.1 The 4-Tier Approval Workflow & Operational Gateway
No purchase request bypasses the Central Store Keeper, regardless of monetary value.

```

### 4.2 Official Store Keeper Approval Sheet (`approval_sheets/view.php`)
- Generated by the Store Keeper upon completing physical inventory checks.
- Contains:
  1. Header banner with College Seal and NAAC A+ / NBA autonomous badges.
  2. Summary of existing central stock (e.g. "Zero buffer in central; immediate procurement necessary").
  3. Technical specification verification notes.
  4. Selected vendor quote, base price, GST % (18%), and total landed cost.
  5. 4 official signature blocks: HOD, Store Keeper, Vice Principal, and Principal.

### 4.3 Procurement, PO & GRN Inward Flow (`procurement/index.php`)
- **Quotation Comparison Statement**: Compares multiple vendor quotes (Rate, GST, Delivery period, Warranty, Rating) and highlights the lowest quoted **L1 Recommendation**.
- **Purchase Order (PO)**: Generates printable official PO with college terms & conditions, payment milestones, delivery schedule, and 3-party signatures (`views/procurement/po.php`).
- **Goods Receipt Note (GRN)**: Store Keeper performs physical delivery inspection, enters accepted and rejected quantities, logs quality notes, and triggers automatic credit to central stock balances.

### 4.4 Stock Distribution & Delivery Vouchers (`distribution/index.php`)
- Central Store Keeper generates formal Store Issue Vouchers or Delivery Challans.
- Dispatched items update the departmental custody register.
- The recipient Department Coordinator physically checks materials and submits a digital acknowledgment (`views/distribution/voucher.php`), printing a 3-party signed voucher.

### 4.5 Inter-Department Transfers (`movement/index.php`)
- Handles scenarios such as: *CSE has 10 surplus keyboards, and ECE requires 5 units.*
- Lifecycle: `Submitted` &rarr; `Store Keeper Approved` &rarr; `Dispatched (In Transit)` &rarr; `Acknowledged & Closed`.

### 4.6 IT Asset Custody & Maintenance (`assets/index.php` & `maintenance/index.php`)

## 8. Universal Display Auto-Fit Architecture (PC, Laptop & Windows DPI)

MSEC Smart Stock implements a fluid, device-agnostic responsive layout engine engineered to adapt automatically across all Windows laptops, desktop monitors, and custom OS scaling levels:

1. **Fluid CSS `clamp()` System**:
   - Dynamic typography: `font-size: clamp(14px, 0.85rem + 0.22vw, 16.5px)` smoothly scales font sizes based on viewport resolution rather than rigid breakpoints.
   - Adaptive Sidebar: Scales between `240px` (on 1366px compact laptops) and `275px` (on 1920px+ desktop PCs) to maximize data workspace.
   - Adaptive Padding: Viewport padding fluidly adjusts from `16px` to `36px` to prevent wasted margins.

2. **Windows DPI Scaling Normalization**:
   - Automatically inspects `window.devicePixelRatio` and viewport width.
   - On Windows laptops with 125% or 150% display scaling enabled (common in 14"–15.6" 1080p and 4K displays), the engine normalizes zoom to `1.0` to avoid artificial double-scaling and prevent horizontal scrollbars.
   - On large widescreen desktop monitors ($\ge 1800px$) with native 100% DPI, Auto-Fit applies a comfortable `1.15` magnification factor for bold, authoritative ERP viewing.

3. **Smart Header & Grid Resilience**:
   - Zero-wrap header layout ensures brand titles, institutional subheaders, notification bells, scale controllers, and persona selectors stay on a single line.
   - `.responsive-split-grid` displays 2 columns on wide monitors ($\ge 1280px$) and seamlessly transitions to single-column on smaller laptop screens without column clipping.
